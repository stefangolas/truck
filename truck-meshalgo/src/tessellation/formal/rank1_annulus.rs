//! The shared realization of a rank-one periodic annulus.
//!
//! # What this module is, and what it deliberately is not
//!
//! A surface with a **free** rank-one deck action develops into a chart with
//! one aperiodic coordinate and one periodic one. Two complete, oppositely
//! oriented, essential loops in that chart — one turn each, at two separated
//! values of the aperiodic coordinate — bound a compact annular strip. Cutting
//! that strip once transversally to the deck direction opens it into a single
//! rectangle-like patch; the patch triangulates in the plane; and an explicit
//! **edge identification**, discharged by merging vertex *identities* rather
//! than coordinates, glues the cut back and recovers the annulus.
//!
//! Every step of that paragraph is chart arithmetic. None of it knows what the
//! ambient surface is. So it lives here once, and both the cylinder
//! ([`super::cylinder_band`]) and the cone ([`super::cone_band`]) reach it.
//!
//! **What does not live here is admission.** This module never decides that a
//! face *is* an annulus. It is handed two already-developed boundary chains
//! and a statement of the obligations the ambient certifier discharged, and its
//! job is to realize the strip those chains bound — or to refuse. The semantic
//! gates are genuinely different on the two supports and stay in their own
//! modules:
//!
//! ```text
//! cylinder    two complete parallels of one embedded cylinder are either the
//!             same circle or separated along the axis; the support has no
//!             singular orbit anywhere, so no strip of it can contain one
//!
//! cone        the carriers live at signed generator coordinates whose radii
//!             differ; both must be proved to lie strictly on one nappe, and
//!             the apex — the one orbit where the deck action is not free —
//!             must be proved to lie outside the closed carrier interval
//! ```
//!
//! # Why the obligations are re-verified here rather than trusted
//!
//! [`RankOnePeriodicAnnulus`] carries the ambient certifier's conclusions as
//! typed values, not as booleans, and [`realize`] **checks the ones it can
//! check** before it builds anything: opposite primitive homology from the
//! chains themselves, a strictly positive carrier separation, and — where the
//! support has a singular orbit — that the singular coordinate really does lie
//! strictly outside the closed span of both chains. A cell that named an
//! obligation it had not discharged is refused with
//! [`AnnulusExit::ObligationNotDischarged`] rather than realized.
//!
//! That is not defence in depth for its own sake. It is what makes "the cone
//! reuses the cylinder's realizer" a safe sentence: the realizer's own
//! preconditions are checked against the data it was actually given, so
//! reaching it through a new ambient adapter cannot smuggle in a fact that
//! adapter never proved.
//!
//! # Why the patch is not ear-clipped
//!
//! [`super::planar_slice::triangulate`] is reused everywhere the formal
//! subtree needs a *disk*, and this module reuses its certificate
//! ([`certified_polygonal_region`]) and its checker ([`final_validity`])
//! unchanged. It cannot supply the patch's triangles, for a structural
//! reason rather than a stylistic one: ear clipping a convex patch fans it
//! from one vertex, and that apex is one of the two developed lifts of a cut
//! vertex, so the fan always contains a triangle carrying *both* lifts. That
//! triangle is degenerate the moment the identification is discharged.
//! [`triangulate_annulus_patch`] walks the two boundary chains instead, which
//! by construction never puts both lifts of one cut vertex in one triangle —
//! and its output is then handed to the *same* [`final_validity`] battery, so
//! the strengthening is in the producer only, never in the checking.
