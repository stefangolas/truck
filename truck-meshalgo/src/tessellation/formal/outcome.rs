//! Four result layers, kept apart on purpose.
//!
//! `FORMAL_SYSTEM.md` Definition 3 fixes the semantic algebra:
//!
//! ```text
//! SemanticOutcome ::= Valid(R) | Inconsistent(I) | Ambiguous(A)
//!                   | Unsupported(U) | Unresolved(N)
//! ```
//!
//! and Definition 4 immediately adds a *separate* judgment:
//!
//! ```text
//! RealizationOutcome ::= Realized(M) | RecognizedButUnsupported(R_u)
//!                      | RealizationFailure(R_f)
//! ```
//!
//! Neither describes a stage, and neither describes the machine. Collapsing
//! these into one type is the failure this module exists to prevent:
//!
//! - **A stage is not a face.** Resolving a face's ambient period says nothing
//!   about whether its region is valid; §XI is explicit that even a unique
//!   material labelling does not imply a valid region. A successful stage
//!   returns [`StageOutcome::Resolved`] carrying that stage's product.
//!
//! - **A failure of the machine is not a fact about the geometry.** An
//!   allocator refusal, an `i64` overflow or an exhausted budget are facts
//!   about *this run*. Reporting one as `Unsupported` would assert that the
//!   face lies outside the declared envelope, which is a claim about the face
//!   and is not what was observed. [`OperationalFailure`] is the `Err` of
//!   [`StageEvaluation`], never a variant of an outcome, and there is no
//!   `From<OperationalFailure>` for `StageOutcome`.
//!
//! - **A missing mesher is not an invalid face.** Definition 4's separation is
//!   why [`RealizationOutcome`] carries the [`ValidSemantic`] through all three
//!   of its variants: a realization failure leaves semantic validity intact.
//!
//! # Reports are constructed, not composed
//!
//! Every report has private fields and a checked constructor. Public fields
//! would allow an `UnsupportedReport` naming a pair-intersection clause while
//! carrying a lattice-rank witness — two halves of two different judgments,
//! typechecking fine and meaning nothing. Each report is built from a single
//! authoritative cause and derives whatever else it exposes.
