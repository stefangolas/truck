//! Certified identification of an embedded conical support surface, with its
//! apex located rather than assumed away.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! The rank-1 companion to [`super::cylinder`]. A STEP `conical_surface`
//! reaches the tessellator as the *same* representation a cylinder does —
//! `Processor<RevolutedCurve<Line<Point3>>, Matrix4>` (see `truck-stepio`'s
//! `ConicalSurface`) — and differs from it in exactly one structural fact: the
//! revolved line is **tilted** with respect to the axis instead of parallel to
//! it. [`identify_cone`] reads the inner [`RevolutedCurve<Line<Point3>>`]
//! structurally and either certifies an embedded cone or refuses with a named
//! reason.
//!
//! Because the representation is shared, so is the periodicity: the `2π`
//! angular period the cylinder certifies is certified here by the same
//! evaluation, and the deck generator is the same object on the same developed
//! axis. This module adds no new periodicity mathematics. What it adds is the
//! apex.
//!
//! # The apex is the whole difference
//!
//! A cylinder is regular everywhere: every orbit of its angular deck action is
//! a circle of the cylinder's own positive radius, at every axial coordinate.
//! A cone is not. At one point of the axis the revolved line meets it, the
//! orbit collapses to a point, the deck action stops being free, and every
//! chart built on the quotient degenerates.
//!
//! So a certified cone must **locate** that point, not merely avoid it. This
//! module solves for it in closed form from the generatrix's own
//! representation and then verifies the solution lies on the axis, which is
//! also the test that separates a cone from a one-sheet hyperboloid: a
//! revolved line that is tilted *and skew* to the axis never meets it and
//! sweeps a hyperboloid, whose signature at a face boundary can look exactly
//! like a frustum's. That surface is refused by name
//! ([`ConeIdentificationFailure::GeneratrixSkewToAxis`]) rather than fitted to
//! a cone.
//!
//! # The developed coordinate system
//!
//! The cone develops into a chart with two coordinates, on the same
//! `(aperiodic = First, periodic = Second)` convention the cylinder fixes:
//!
//! - the **generator** coordinate `s = (x - apex) · axis`, signed, aperiodic,
//!   and zero exactly at the apex;
//! - the **angular** coordinate `theta`, defined so that it advances with the
//!   surface's own revolution parameter `v`:
//!   `theta = atan2((x - origin) · radial_y, (x - origin) · radial_x)` with
//!   `radial_y = axis × radial_x`.
//!
//! `s` rather than a raw axial coordinate, and that choice is the substance of
//! the packet's first new obligation. On a cylinder two parallels are ordered
//! by an axial coordinate whose origin is arbitrary, because every level is
//! alike. On a cone the levels are not alike: the radius at `s` is
//! `slope · |s|`, the sign of `s` names the **nappe**, and `s = 0` is the
//! singular orbit. Stating a carrier's position in `s` therefore carries the
//! half-angle and the apex with it, and "these two carriers lie on one nappe
//! with the apex outside the interval between them" becomes a statement about
//! the signs and order of two numbers rather than a claim about proximity.
//!
//! `theta` is a genuine `2π`-periodic coordinate on **both** nappes: the
//! revolution rotates every point about the axis right-handedly, whichever
//! side of the apex it is on, so `theta` advances with `v` on both. The one
//! difference is a constant offset of `π` between the nappes, because the
//! recorded `radial_x` is the radial direction of a point on one particular
//! side. That offset is irrelevant to everything downstream — nothing here
//! compares a `theta` on one nappe against a `theta` on the other, because
//! [`super::cone_band`] refuses a face whose carriers are not on one nappe
//! before any chart arithmetic happens.
