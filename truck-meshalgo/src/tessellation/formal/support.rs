//! Structural identification of the authoritative support-surface schema.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! Step 1 measured the corpus and found `0 / 24,199` faces resolving to a
//! certified ambient lattice, with `22,681` exiting as
//! `PeriodAbsenceNotEstablished`. That number is honest but it is not a fact
//! about the faces: `12,122` of them are planes, and a plane is aperiodic on
//! both axes by an analytic rule that has been in [`super::ambient`] since Step
//! 1 landed.
//!
//! Nothing could apply that rule, because the only surface description
//! reaching the tessellator is
//! [`super::super::domain::lattice::CertifiedLattice`], and that type's
//! `AxisPeriodStatus::NonPeriodic` has two producers — `NON_PERIODIC`, an
//! analytic claim about a plane, and `from_unevidenced_accessor(None)`, a bare
//! accessor that returned nothing. Once constructed the two are
//! indistinguishable, so the adapter must map both to `Undetermined` or it
//! would assign a torus a trivial deck group.
//!
//! The fix is not to weaken the adapter. It is to read the *representation*
//! before it is erased, one step earlier in the pipeline, and to hand the
//! formal resolver a witness that a plane was actually seen.
//!
//! # The admitted path
//!
//! ```text
//! authoritative support-surface schema identifies a plane
//!   -> analytic premise SupportSurfaceIsAPlane
//!   -> certify U-axis aperiodicity
//!   -> certify V-axis aperiodicity
//!   -> CertifiedAmbientLattice::Rank0
//! ```
//!
//! and the forbidden one:
//!
//! ```text
//! legacy lattice says NonPeriodic -> guess that the surface is a plane
//! period accessor returned None  -> infer aperiodicity
//! ```
//!
//! # How the premise is made unforgeable
//!
//! [`PlaneSchema`]'s fields are private and it has exactly one constructor:
//! [`identify_plane`], which takes `&truck_geometry::prelude::Plane` by value
//! reference. A caller cannot produce one without holding an actual plane
//! representation. [`super::ambient::certify_plane_aperiodicity`] takes
//! `&PlaneSchema`, so the premise `SupportSurfaceIsAPlane` is discharged by
//! *presenting the plane*, not by choosing to call a particular function.
//!
//! Every other schema is [`SupportSurfaceSchema::NotStructurallyIdentified`],
//! which carries no authority at all and whose constructor is public precisely
//! because it grants nothing. A composition layer that meets a surface it has
//! no structural reader for says so, and the face exits `Unresolved`.
//!
//! # Degenerate bases are not planes for this purpose
//!
//! `AnalyticRule::PlaneHasNoPeriodicDirection` stands on the parameterisation
//! being *injective* on `R^2`. `Plane::subs(u, v) = o + u(p-o) + v(q-o)` is
//! injective exactly when `p-o` and `q-o` are linearly independent. If they
//! are parallel the map is genuinely periodic — with `u_axis == v_axis`,
//! `S(u+1, v-1) = S(u, v)` for every `(u, v)` — so certifying absence from the
//! entity type alone would be *false*, not merely unproved. [`identify_plane`]
//! therefore refuses a basis it cannot separate, and the refusal is
//! [`SchemaIdentificationFailure::PlaneBasisNotSeparated`].
