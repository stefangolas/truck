//! Generic contact and event contracts: the surface ARR-003 consumes.
//!
//! ARR-002's [`super::intersection::PairIntersectionResult`] is pairwise —
//! exactly two curve incidences per result, isolated points only, overlap a
//! bare tag. GEN-001 lifts these into a family-independent model:
//!
//! - an isolated event carries an **arbitrary number** of incident branches
//!   ([`IsolatedEvent2`]), so a genuine triple event is one event, not three
//!   pairwise pseudo-events;
//! - contact is either an isolated event or a positive-dimensional common arc
//!   ([`ContactComponent2`]);
//! - identity is construction- and provenance-based ([`EventIdentity`]), never
//!   coordinate proximity.
//!
//! GEN-001A provides the types and a faithful adapter ([`lift_pair_result`])
//! from the existing pairwise result. The adapter turns each ARR-002 isolated
//! intersection into one two-branch isolated event under a stable identity; it
//! does **not** merge pairwise results into shared multi-branch events. That
//! merge is ARR-003's responsibility, and it uses the stable identities
//! introduced here.
//!
//! GEN-001D adds the rank/deck contract to the event layer: each
//! [`IsolatedEvent2`] carries one shared ambient [`DeckContext`] (bound to one
//! certified lattice) and each [`BranchIncidence`] carries a validated,
//! lattice-bound [`CertifiedDeckLabel`]. Event deck identity is canonical and
//! **relative**: [`IsolatedEvent2::deck_signature`] normalizes the gauge by
//! ordering the incidences canonically ([`CanonicalIncidenceId`] — source
//! occurrence + canonical branch side, never parameter-enclosure bits) and
//! subtracting the canonical anchor label. [`IsolatedEvent2::pair_contact_lift_key`]
//! pairs that with the pair/lift construction identity; it is explicitly **not**
//! a final aggregate vertex identity — ARR-003 certifies the complete event
//! equivalence class and produces an [`AggregatedQuotientEventKey`]. Absolute
//! lifts are gauge-dependent and never determine event identity; the existing
//! rank-1 solver's verdicts are adapted by `adapt_axis_aligned_placement` and
//! attached end to end by [`label_branch_from_placement`] without any
//! nearest-integer rounding. Rank-2 *labels* are carried and validated; rank-2
//! geometric *placement* stays a typed [`DeckPlacementResult::Unsupported`] (no
//! unreviewed closest-vector algorithm is invented).
//!
//! # A7 — the chord-side representative is hidden, not yet repaired
//!
//! ARR-002's chord-side membership test reads rounded evaluated arc endpoints
//! (`arc.start.point()` / `arc.end.point()`); see `GEN-001.md` assumption A7.
//! It is sound today only under the ≤π monotone-piece precondition. The generic
//! contract repairs this *structurally* in GEN-001A: every incident branch
//! carries a certified [`super::span::BranchGerm`], and ARR-003 consumes germs —
//! never representative coordinates — for ordering and topology. The analytic
//! orient test itself is replaced by a germ-based test in GEN-001C.
