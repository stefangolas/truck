//! The first end-to-end vertical slice: a planar, line-bounded, hole-free face.
//!
//! # What this module is
//!
//! Steps 2 through 8 of `FORMAL_SYSTEM.md` §XVIII, implemented *only* far
//! enough to carry one face of the admitted subset from source evidence to a
//! validated triangle mesh, and to refuse everything else truthfully. It is
//! deliberately not a general implementation of any of those stages: the
//! milestone is a complete chain, not a complete stage.
//!
//! ```text
//! Step 0 source evidence
//!   -> Step 1 certified planar rank-0 ambient
//!   -> Step 2 regular source traversal
//!   -> Step 3 certified planar curve occurrences
//!   -> Step 4 rank-0 developed boundary
//!   -> Step 5 trivial deck and holonomy solution
//!   -> Step 6 one-copy working cover
//!   -> Step 7 certified simple Jordan arrangement
//!   -> bounded-interior material selection
//!   -> Step 8A certified polygonal approximation
//!   -> Step 8B constrained triangulation
//!   -> final validity
//! ```
//!
//! # The admitted subset
//!
//! A face enters only when *every* predicate holds. Anything else exits as
//! `Unresolved`, `Unsupported`, `Inconsistent` or `OperationalFailure`, with an
//! exit reason naming the obstruction, and no heuristic repair is attempted
//! anywhere. [`SliceExit`] is the complete list of ways out.
//!
//! # Why the curve family is line segments and polylines
//!
//! Both project *exactly* under the plane's affine inverse, so Step 3 needs no
//! numerical certificate and Step 8A's approximation error is zero. That
//! collapses three obligations onto one object — the developed boundary is the
//! polygon is the mesh boundary — which is what makes a first slice tractable.
//!
//! The collapse is guarded, not assumed. [`PolygonalRegion`] refuses to claim
//! the source-curve Jordan proof also settles polygon simplicity unless every
//! occurrence's approximation error is *exactly* zero
//! ([`Rank0DevelopedBoundary::approximation_is_exact`]). The first arc family
//! that arrives will fail that guard and be forced through its own check
//! rather than inheriting this one.
//!
//! # Why ear clipping rather than the `spade` CDT
//!
//! Final validity here is the eleven-item battery of Step 8B, including "the
//! union of the triangles is the polygonal region" and "the mesh boundary
//! equals the expected polygon cycle". A CDT triangulates the convex hull, so
//! reaching those claims from one requires deciding which triangles are inside
//! — and a centroid containment test is exactly what Step 8B forbids as a
//! substitute for the obligations. Ear clipping on a polygon already *proved*
//! simple inserts no Steiner points and emits only interior triangles, so every
//! item in the battery is a check on what was produced rather than a repair of
//! it. The battery still runs independently; nothing is taken on the
//! algorithm's word.
