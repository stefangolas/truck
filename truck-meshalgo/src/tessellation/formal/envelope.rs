//! The formal complexity envelope and the execution budget.
//!
//! `FORMAL_SYSTEM.md` Definition 6 gives the envelope
//! `β = (r_max, s_max, n_max, e_max, w_max, x_max, v_max, g_max)` and adds:
//! *"The exact numerical values are policy. The closure proof requires only
//! that they are finite."* Definition 11 then makes membership in `E_β` the
//! precondition for Theorem 1's closure claim.
//!
//! # Why there is no `Default`
//!
//! An envelope is a *claim about what has been proved to work*. A default one
//! would be a claim nobody made, silently attached to every call site that
//! omitted the argument — and because `Unsupported` is a judgment about the
//! face, an invented `s_max` would produce invented verdicts. The project
//! documents specify exactly one value, `r_max ≤ 2`; every other bound remains
//! an open policy decision, so callers pass one explicitly or do not proceed.
//! The same argument applies to [`ExecutionBudget`].
//!
//! **Zero is a policy, not a defect.** `max_pair_intersections = 0` says
//! "self-intersecting boundaries are not admitted"; `max_refinement_depth = 0`
//! says "no refinement is permitted". Both are coherent, so the constructors
//! accept them. The only value the constructor refuses is `r_max > 2`, which
//! Definition 6 forbids outright.
//!
//! # Why they are two types
//!
//! They answer different questions and their failures have different
//! classifications:
//!
//! - Exceeding a [`FormalEnvelope`] bound is a **proved property of the face**
//!   → `Unsupported`.
//! - Exhausting an [`ExecutionBudget`] is a **property of this run** → an
//!   `OperationalFailure`, or a named stage-specific `Unresolved`.
//!
//! Merging them would make "we did not look hard enough" indistinguishable
//! from "this face is outside the declared envelope". Only the second is a
//! statement about STEP.
//!
//! # Two things a measurement must carry
//!
//! The boundary convention is stated once, in [`check`], and applied nowhere
//! else: `observed <= maximum` is admitted, `observed > maximum` is outside,
//! and a certified lower bound rejects only when it *strictly* exceeds the
//! maximum. A lower bound equal to the maximum is consistent with the true
//! count being exactly the maximum, which is admitted, so it proves nothing.
//!
//! And every observation names the [`MeasurementSubject`] it counted, checked
//! against the clause it is tested under. Without that, nothing stops an arc
//! count being compared against `x_max`; the numbers would typecheck and the
//! verdict would be meaningless.
