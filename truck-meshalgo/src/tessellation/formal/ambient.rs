//! Ambient period authority: what the deck lattice is, and who may use it.
//!
//! `FORMAL_SYSTEM.md` Definition 7 makes the ambient schema carry
//! `Λ = LZ^r` with `0 ≤ r ≤ r_max`, and Definition 8 makes the semantic
//! parameter object the quotient `(Ω/Λ)/Σ`. Everything downstream — the deck
//! displacement `δ` of Definition 9, the potential equations of §VII, the
//! candidate translation sets `K_ij` of Definition 16, the vertex
//! identification `~_Λ` of §IX — is stated in terms of `Λ`. If `Λ` is wrong,
//! every one of those is wrong in a way no later stage can detect.
//!
//! # The distinction this module exists for
//!
//! The corpus census over `00009190` reports:
//!
//! ```text
//!                 declared_rank    certified_rank
//!     rank 0         12,122           13,770
//!     rank 1         10,720           10,429
//!     rank 2          1,357                0
//! ```
//!
//! 1,357 faces declare rank 2 and certify rank 0; a further 291 declare rank 1
//! and certify rank 0. Reading `certified_rank() == 0` as `r = 0` would assign
//! all 1,648 of them a trivial deck group — asserting that no translation
//! identifies their parameter points — when what actually happened is that
//! *periodicity was declared and nothing certified it*. Those are different
//! propositions, and the corpus contains faces that distinguish them: a torus
//! is doubly periodic whatever `curve.period()` returns.
//!
//! So `certified_rank() == 0` supports no ambient conclusion at all. This
//! module gives the five states that are actually distinguishable —
//! authoritatively absent, certified, declared but uncertified, undetermined,
//! contradictory — and only the first two can feed a rank.
//!
//! # Introduction rules, not constructors
//!
//! Authority here is minted only by the named rules in the *introduction
//! rules* section — [`certify_plane_aperiodicity`],
//! [`certify_straight_generatrix_aperiodicity`],
//! [`certify_revolution_period`], [`certify_period_numerically`] — each of
//! which supplies the premises its rule requires. There is no public way to
//! hand a number and a rule name to [`CertifiedPeriodGenerator`] and get
//! authority back.
//!
//! # Two APIs, not one permissive one
//!
//! A single `period_for(use_case) -> Option<f64>` would put the decision at
//! the call site, where it is invisible in review and unchecked by the
//! compiler. Instead the authority is carried by the *type*:
//!
//! - [`AmbientPeriodEvidence::diagnostic_hints`] yields
//!   [`DeclaredPeriodHint`]s. They are named for what they are and convert
//!   into nothing.
//! - [`CertifiedAmbientLattice`] is the only type with deck operations on it,
//!   and it is obtainable only from [`resolve_ambient_periods`].
