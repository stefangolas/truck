//! Evidence authority: what is known, on what basis, and who may *make* the
//! claim.
//!
//! `FORMAL_SYSTEM.md` Definition 2 makes a geometric fact a pair `Fact(P, κ)`
//! with `κ ∈ {Declared, Analytic, CertifiedNumerical, Assumed, Unresolved}`,
//! and adds: *"A production implementation may rely on a fact only if its
//! status meets the requirement of the consuming stage."*
//!
//! Three consequences drive this module's shape.
//!
//! **`Unresolved` carries no value.** A `struct Fact<T> { value: T, status }`
//! is unsound for this definition, because `Unresolved` is precisely the state
//! in which no proposition value has been established — such a struct forces
//! the construction of a `T` that stands for nothing. [`Evidence`] is a sum
//! type whose `Unresolved` variant has no `T` field at all. The value is not
//! hidden from unauthorized readers; it does not exist.
//!
//! **Authority is not a scale.** Definition 2's five statuses are *kinds* of
//! justification, not degrees of confidence, and the consuming stage names its
//! requirement. There is deliberately no ordering such as
//! `Declared > Analytic > CertifiedNumerical`: a stage that must read what
//! STEP literally said ([`EvidenceRequirement::SourceDeclaration`]) is not
//! served by a derivation, and a stage that must not depend on an exporter's
//! word ([`EvidenceRequirement::AnalyticOnly`]) is not served by a
//! declaration.
//!
//! **Authority cannot be forged.** Restricting who may *read* a claim is only
//! half the problem; a `pub fn analytic(value, rule)` lets any call site mint
//! the authority it wants. The three authority-bearing constructors are
//! therefore `pub(super)`, reachable only from inside this `formal` subtree,
//! and every authoritative value a caller can obtain comes from a named
//! introduction rule that checks the rule's own premises — for ambient
//! periods, [`super::ambient::certify_plane_aperiodicity`] and its siblings.
//! [`Evidence::assumed`] and [`Evidence::unresolved`] stay public because
//! neither produces authority.
