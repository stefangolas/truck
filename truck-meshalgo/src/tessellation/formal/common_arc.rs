//! Certified CommonArc substrate (GEN-001E).
//!
//! A [`CommonArc2`] is a certified **positive-dimensional connected overlap
//! component** between two source-curve occurrences. It is not a tangent
//! point, an endpoint-only meeting, two nearby curves, a sampled
//! approximation, or a sequence of isolated intersections.
//!
//! # The admitted certified support classes
//!
//! The minimal supported cases are those whose proof comes from source or
//! construction identity, never from evaluated geometry:
//!
//! - **provenance-identical support** ([`CommonSupportBasis::IdenticalSourceProvenance`]):
//!   both participants share one authoritative source occurrence (identical
//!   `SpanId`, preserved verbatim by certified subdivision), so both cover
//!   certified intervals of the same authoritative source parameter axis.
//! - **identical admitted analytic support** ([`CommonSupportBasis::IdenticalAnalyticSupport`]):
//!   distinct occurrences whose support identity is certified by exact
//!   predicates — collinear lines (exact parallel cross and exact
//!   point-on-line) or equal circles (exact center, exact squared radius,
//!   and the same authoritative parameterization). Approximate center/radius
//!   or sampled-point equality is never used.
//!
//! Everything else — general algebraic common components, unrelated
//! rational-Bézier equivalence, arbitrary rational reparameterization — is a
//! typed [`CommonArcError`] (mostly `UnsupportedSupportIdentity`), never a
//! guess from proximity.
//!
//! # Parameter correspondence
//!
//! Each participant carries a [`CertifiedParameterCorrespondence`]: a
//! certified affine map from its own traversal parameter to the canonical
//! source axis (identity, reversal, or an explicitly certified analytic
//! affine map). No unchecked public constructor can claim a correspondence
//! without evidence; every map is built inside this module from exact source
//! data and validated by [`CommonArc2::validate`].
//!
//! # Identity
//!
//! [`CommonArcIdentity`] is construction-based and canonical: the shared
//! support identity, the sorted participant occurrences, the relative
//! orientation class, the canonical ordered overlap bounds, and the
//! gauge-normalized relative deck displacement. It is independent of operand
//! order, input vector order, representative coordinates, discovery order,
//! source traversal reversal, subdivision depth and common deck translation.
//! It never derives from rounded interval endpoints or a representative point.
