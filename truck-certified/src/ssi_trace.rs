//! The SSI branch-tracing continuation loop (BG-CK-P2-TRACE).
//!
//! The module owns the trace discipline against the shim's frozen types and
//! the fixture kit, and (since the integration amendment) the PRODUCTION seam:
//! a [`BranchCertifier`] implemented over W1's landed API (`ssi.rs`) and the
//! crate-public [`certified_pair_trace`] entry point that RESIDUAL's harness
//! calls. The solver-private loop drives a per-box certifier interface
//! ([`BranchCertifier`], [`BranchBox`], [`BranchStep`]) whose synthetic
//! certifiers walk the fixture kit's known geometry in this module's tests;
//! the production certifier composes W1's certified primitives (never a local
//! re-implementation of the frozen F3 rule) and classifies germs with
//! [`classify_branch_germ`].
//!
//! # The discipline this module owns
//!
//! - **Seed.** A branch is traced from one isolated [`KrawczykCertificate3`]
//!   (the shim's Krawczyk3 output shape). The loop hands the seed to the
//!   certifier as the first box hint and consumes the certified steps it
//!   reports.
//! - **Identity recurrence.** A step whose box equals the first box's identity
//!   closes the branch: [`TraceOutcome::ClosedLoop`] (the `closed_loop_pair()`
//!   fixture's ground truth).
//! - **Domain exit, no refusal.** A step whose box has left the chart domain is
//!   a natural end: [`TraceOutcome::Terminated`].
//! - **Turning-point switching is the frozen both-certificate rule.** A
//!   coordinate switch is emitted ONLY as a [`CoordinateSwitch`] carrying both
//!   certificates (the frozen F3 contract in `contract.rs`; no default, no
//!   heuristic reseed). A certifier that reports a switch box with ONE
//!   certificate is a refusal, never a reseed; the loop refuses with the named
//!   conditioning case. The loop itself never reseeds: a certified box is
//!   accepted as it is, and only an under-certified switch report is refused.
//! - **Refusals are named.** Every refusal the loop can emit wraps a LANDED
//!   named cause through [`TraceRefusal`]; there is no catch-all and no stringly
//!   refusal.
//!
//! # Branch records and germs
//!
//! Every emitted [`TraceStep`] carries the [`BranchIncidence`]-shaped record
//! (span + certified parameter enclosure + germ + deck label, `formal/contact.rs`)
//! and the certified continuation coordinate for its box. Germ classification
//! follows the `span.rs` discipline: a zero first jet reads the next nonzero
//! jet ([`classify_branch_germ`]); its correctness is machine-checked against
//! the `germ_ladder()` fixture in the in-module tests.
//!
//! H-1: this module (including its `#[cfg(test)]` code) is written under the
//! crate-level `deny` lint with no module-level opt-out, matching the HULL
//! precedent.
