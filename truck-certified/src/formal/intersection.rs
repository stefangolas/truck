#![allow(clippy::unwrap_used)]

//! Certified pair intersection of x-monotone pieces.
//!
//! # What this module does
//!
//! [`intersect_x_monotone`] dispatches two [`XMonotonePiece2`] values to the
//! correct family-specific predicate (line–line, line–circle,
//! circle–circle) and returns a [`PairIntersectionResult`] whose variants
//! name every way the result can be nondeterminate.
//!
//! # Exactness policy
//!
//! Every decision that admits topology is an exact predicate over the `f64`
//! inputs, computed with the Shewchuk expansion arithmetic in
//! [`super::exact`] — never a tolerance, and never a rounded equality:
//!
//! - **line–line** uses [`super::planar_slice::classify_segments`]
//!   (`robust::orient2d`); the contact type is the exact sign of the
//!   direction cross product, so a single-point result is `Transverse`
//!   only for non-parallel tangents. Parallel single-point touches are
//!   collinear endpoint contacts (`Tangent`) and require a shared source
//!   vertex to be admitted at all.
//! - **line–circle** certifies the sign of the discriminant
//!   `D = 4(A·R² − O²)` where `A = |d|²`, `R² = |cos_basis|²` and
//!   `O = orient(start, end, center)`; every factor is an exact expansion
//!   and `O²` is an exact expansion product, so the sign decides the exact
//!   number and type of support-circle intersections. `d = end − start` is
//!   the **exact** coordinate difference (a `two_sum` expansion,
//!   [`Expansion::from_sum`]) — never a rounded `f64` vector — so the
//!   Lagrange identity `A·|w|² − (w·d)² = (d×w)²` (with `w = start − center`)
//!   sees the same exact direction in the norm, the dot and the cross.
//!   Rounded direction vectors appear only as representative/evaluation
//!   hints.
//! - **circle–circle** certifies the sign of the radical-axis discriminant
//!   `S = 2A·R1 + 2A·R2 − R1² − R2² − A² + 2R1R2` over the exact squared
//!   distance and exact squared radii (again by expansion products).
//!
//! The discriminant signs certify the *support-curve* intersection count,
//! **not** the finite-piece intersections. Each root is constructed as a
//! **certified parameter enclosure** — directed-rounding interval arithmetic
//! ([`super::exact::CertifiedInterval`]) over the exact expansions — and
//! membership on the finite pieces is decided by **exact predicates**:
//!
//! - a line piece by certified interval separation of the root parameter
//!   against `[0, 1]`, with exact endpoint identity admissions (a root at
//!   `0` or `1` is admitted only when the line's own endpoint is exactly on
//!   the support circle, decided by the exact on-circle predicate);
//! - a circular-arc piece by **certified parameter membership** (the A7
//!   repair, GEN-001E): the root's certified arc-parameter enclosure is
//!   compared against the piece's authoritative endpoint parameters (the
//!   source's declared trim values or the certified critical enclosures).
//!   No rounded evaluated endpoint coordinate decides membership.
//!
//! # Endpoint identity and the parameter-membership precondition
//!
//! An arc endpoint is admitted as the location of a root only on a
//! certificate, never from enclosure overlap alone, and never from an exact
//! predicate over a rounded `cos`/`sin` evaluation of the endpoint — a
//! rounded representative is not the semantic endpoint, so exact arithmetic
//! on it certifies neither incidence nor radical-axis side:
//!
//! 1. **Shared provenance identity.** A source-vertex endpoint shared with
//!    the other piece's endpoint is certified by the shared
//!    [`SourceVertexKey`]; the intersection coordinate is then the other
//!    piece's declared endpoint coordinate (an exact `f64` for a line), and
//!    circle incidence is an exact predicate on that declared geometry. The
//!    analogous artificial-vertex identity is the shared
//!    [`super::xmonotone::CriticalIdentity`] of a monotone split.
//! 2. **Certified attribution to an isolated root at the authoritative
//!    endpoint parameter.** The root's certified parameter enclosure on the
//!    arc must overlap the endpoint's authoritative parameter — the source's
//!    declared trim value, or the critical point's certified enclosure —
//!    and every other root's enclosure must be certified disjoint from it.
//!    This identifies *the* root at the endpoint without trusting a rounded
//!    evaluated point.
//!
//! The membership test rests on the x-monotone decomposition's guarantee: a
//! nondegenerate x-monotone circle piece covers exactly the certified
//! parameter range between its authoritative endpoints (the source's
//! unwrapped interval split at the certified x-critical enclosures). A root's
//! certified parameter enclosure is therefore compared against that range
//! ([`arc_parameter_membership`]) — Interior only when strictly between the
//! two endpoint parameters, Exterior only when certifiably outside, and
//! Boundary when it touches a piece boundary. This replaces the A7
//! chord-side orient test, which read rounded evaluated arc endpoints
//! (`arc.start.point()` / `arc.end.point()`); the conservative outcomes are
//! unchanged (a straddle goes to endpoint admission or `Undecidable`, never
//! an invented membership).
//!
//! No tolerance establishes topology. [`LocationOnPiece`] is exhaustive:
//! only a certified [`LocationOnPiece::Exterior`] is silently discarded. An
//! interior root is admitted; an identified endpoint is admitted with its
//! endpoint identity ([`IntersectionIdentity`]); anything undecidable is
//! [`PairUnresolved`]. The evaluation-seed
//! [`parameter_hint_interval`](super::xmonotone::PieceIdentity::parameter_hint_interval)
//! is never consulted.
//!
//! # The exact arithmetic is the canonical single copy
//!
//! The discriminant signs, the root enclosures and the orient coefficients
//! all flow through [`super::exact::Expansion`], which is the **one**
//! Shewchuk implementation in the workspace. `look` consumes it through the
//! `truck-meshalgo` patch and has retired its private copy, so there is no
//! second subtly different `Expansion`.
//!
//! # What this module does NOT handle
//!
//! - positive-length overlap → [`PairUnsupported::Overlap`]
//! - unrelated tangency → [`PairUnsupported::UnrelatedTangency`]
//! - coincident support circles → [`PairUnsupported::CoincidentCircles`]
//! - triple intersections (handled by the sweep, ARR-003)
