//! The §3.3 lifted atlas: pole charts and the rational carrier family
//! (BG-KV2-405-K2B).
//!
//! This module completes the K2 substrate over the rational carriers of
//! §3.2 (BG-KV2-104-RATCARRIER): `Param` lifts whose deck integer is a
//! FIRST-CLASS coordinate, the finite atlas of regular charts per carrier
//! kind with chart ids, overlap regions, and exact affine/rational transition
//! maps with outward-rounded transport, and — as code — §3.4's chart-switch
//! doctrine: a rank-deficient parameterization switches chart when the image
//! is certified regular elsewhere (the pole case), and refuses/trims when the
//! degeneracy is a genuine carrier singularity (the cone apex case).
//!
//! **H-1.** The crate-level `#![deny(clippy::unwrap_used)]` in `lib.rs` covers
//! this module. The module carries no `unwrap`, no `expect`, and no `panic!`
//! calls, and adds no module-level `allow`.
//!
//! **N4 by construction.** No transcendental function appears in this module:
//! every chart map below is polynomial / interval-rational over the
//! `CertifiedInterval` primitive, so no `sin`, `cos`, `atan2`, `exp`, `ln`,
//! `log`, `powf`, or `sqrt` call can appear on any enclosure path (the
//! `no_transcendental_call_in_atlas_module` source test pins this).
//!
//! **The carrier families.** [`ChartAtlas`] owns the finite chart family of a
//! carrier:
//!
//! * *Plane* — one identity chart; the affine `(u, v)` plane chart; no period.
//! * *Cylinder* — one rational half-angle chart (the §3.2 form) with the
//!   surface's exact angular deck generator on the revolution axis when the
//!   axis is exactly a coordinate axis (see [`ChartLattice`]).
//! * *Sphere* — the pole-chart atlas. Two **pole charts** (the rationalized
//!   polar half-angle charts whose `u = tan(θ/2)` collapse onto the pole at
//!   `u = v = 0`) and their **partners** (the stereographic charts that are
//!   regular AT the same pole). An arc crossing `u = v = 0` on a pole chart
//!   continues on the partner chart — same arc, no valence change.
//! * *Cone* — the apex-excluding chart family. The cone's apex is the §3.4
//!   carrier-singularity case: no chart of the family reaches the apex, and a
//!   box that does routes [`DegeneracyRoute::CarrierSingular`]. The cone and
//!   torus carriers JOIN the admitted family here (the Wave-1 404 pending
//!   refusal in `kernel::rational` is a documented re-route: it stays live for
//!   out-of-atlas carriers, while the chart family itself is now constructed
//!   by this module's atlas implementors).
//! * *Torus* — the rational parameterization's chart family (the product of
//!   the two circle half-angle charts).
//!
//! The Cone/Torus chart leaves do not restate the deferred half-angle
//! *enclosure* machinery of §3.2: their `CertifiedPatch` surfaces return the
//! module's no-certificate markers (the crate's established pending form),
//! with the named reasons [`CONE_FORM_PENDING`] / [`TORUS_FORM_PENDING`]. What
//! this module certifies for them is the CHART structure — ids, regions,
//! apex-excluding boxes, transitions — and the §3.4 routing over it.
//!
//! **K2 lifts.** [`ChartAtlas::lift`] is the unwrapped pcurve lift: a `Param`
//! whose `u` is the canonical chart coordinate and whose `deck` integer
//! carries the winding. `Param(5.9)` stays `5.9` (deck `0`); the developed
//! coordinate `6.4` lifts to `deck 1, u = 6.4 − P` — the shim kit's
//! deck-wrap fixture (BG-KV2-000, fixture 5) now runs through the atlas.
//! The lift never wraps an already-lifted coordinate and refuses
//! [`RefusalKind::DeckExhausted`] (Inconclusive) when one edge would walk more
//! than the §0.4 ceiling [`crate::kernel::config::DECK_MAX`] deck crossings.
