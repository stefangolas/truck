//! The §14/§16 certified topology: nodes, breaks, arcs, sheets, and the graph
//! containers (BG-KV2-000-CONTRACT).
//!
//! **H-1.** The crate-level `#![deny(clippy::unwrap_used)]` in `lib.rs` covers
//! this module. The module carries no `unwrap`, no `expect`, and no `panic!`
//! calls, and adds no module-level `allow`.
//!
//! **D-shim.** Topology shapes only; no tracing body. Per the §16 audit
//! "Refuse must not appear in `TopoNode`", NEITHER topology enum carries a
//! `Refuse` variant — a topology node/segment is a certified fact, never a
//! refusal (the integration contract test pins both exhaustive variant lists).
//!
//! **D-spelling.** `Arc` shadows `std::sync::Arc` module-locally (accepted,
//! per the spelling decision). [`NodeCert`] types §2 rule 7's never-unify: an
//! exact point certificate and an at-tolerance contact certificate are
//! different variants and never unify.
//!
//! **D6/§15.** `ClaimedGraph` and `CertifiedGraph` never unify: there is no
//! `From<ClaimedGraph> for CertifiedGraph`, ever.
