//! Certified evaluation substrate for the B-rep generation kernel.
//!
//! This crate is the reference implementation specified by
//! `docs/GENERATION_KERNEL_BUILD_SPEC.md` P-6: it establishes the pattern that
//! every later kernel item copies. It implements
//!
//! - **BG-EVD-001** — the evidence algebra, which now lives in
//!   `truck_base::evidence` and is re-exported here (`outcome`): `Outcome<T>`,
//!   `Certified<T>`, `Refusal`, `Certificate` and the §4 accumulation rules.
//!   The algebra moved to `truck-base` (BG-S0-001) so that `truck-geotrait`'s
//!   `IncludeCurve` can return `Outcome<bool>` without a geotrait→evidence
//!   dependency cycle;
//! - **BG-ENC-001** — the enclosure interface (`enclosure`): `Interval`,
//!   `Box3`, `DirCone` and the `EnclosureCurve`/`EnclosureSurface` traits;
//! - **BG-ENC-002 for `Plane`** (`plane`) — the reference carrier impl;
//! - **BG-ENC-004** (`decorators`) — the compositional carriers, one submodule
//!   per decorator;
//! - **BG-ENC-003** (`bspline`, `nurbs`) — the spline carriers, by the
//!   convex-hull property;
//! - **BG-ANA-001** (`analytic`) — the exactly solvable surface pairs, one
//!   submodule per family, speaking the shared `AnalyticIntersection`;
//! - the shared sampling harness (`harness`) so BG-ENC-001's soundness test is
//!   written once rather than once per carrier.
//!
//! House rules H-1..H-7 (spec §0) apply throughout.
