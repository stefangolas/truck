//! BG-FID-005: the `rep` operator — the ONLY sanctioned path from an exact
//! result into the emitted geometry class. `rep_curve` approximates ONE exact
//! CURVE component to `tau_rep` over a certified partition and returns the
//! achieved error, the achieved tangent margin AND the degree-one certificate
//! TOGETHER — never a bare curve, and never (eps, theta) alone, since
//! (eps, theta) without the (iv) discharge is precisely the unsound pairing
//! (conditions (i)-(iii) pass on a double cover; nothing above the certificate
//! is sound if (iv) is missing).
//!
//! The design point this packet exists to honour: `rep` already subdivides to
//! hit (eps, theta), so its cell decomposition IS the partition that the
//! (iv-b) form of the one-sheet condition requires — per-cell fibre-block
//! containment, per-cell injectivity and non-adjacent separation cost no new
//! subdivision structure, only new assertions on boxes the loop already
//! computes. Implementing (iv) as a separate post-pass over an opaque emitted
//! curve is the expensive way to get the same certificate and is a review
//! reject.
//!
//! The emitter shares the exact curve's parameter space, so cell `D_j` of the
//! emitted curve and cell `I_j` of the exact curve are the SAME interval: the
//! (iv-b) pairing is the identity and no search is needed. The per-cell
//! discharge is:
//!
//! 1. **fibre-block containment (a)** — `sup_distance(H_j, E_j) <= eps_now`,
//!    already guaranteed by the eps measurement, together with item 3 below;
//! 2. **per-cell injectivity (b)** — the knot-projection correspondence: every
//!    INTERIOR knot `t*` of the partition has its projected parameter within
//!    the shared closure of its two cells, certified by isolating the
//!    implicit-function zero `G(s) = <phi(t*) - X(s), X'(s)>` over a small
//!    `s`-interval around `t*` (Krawczyk, BG-NUM-003) and requiring the unique
//!    zero box to touch `t*`;
//! 3. **non-adjacent separation (c)** — for every pair `(j, k)` with `k`
//!    non-adjacent to `j` (`|j-k| = 1` is adjacent, PLUS wrap adjacency for
//!    `Closed`): `box_distance(H_j, E_k) > eps_now`, over the balanced BVH
//!    exposed from [`super::isotopy`] — no O(N^2) scan.
//!
//! What a positive answer establishes is (i)-(iii) of the isotopy conditions
//! between the exact and the emitted curve ON THIS PARTITION plus (iv-b)
//! per-cell fibre-block degree one on the same partition. It establishes NOT
//! isotopy, homeomorphism, side separation, whole-span one-sheet as a
//! topological claim, reach semantics, or the surface case.
//!
//! Scope, decided for you: CURVE components first (REP-CRV-001); the SURFACE
//! case (REP-SRF-001) has since LANDED in this module: `rep_surface`
//! approximates one exact SURFACE patch to `tau_rep` over a certified
//! uniform-per-axis tensor-product partition and returns the achieved error,
//! the achieved normal-angle margin AND the per-cell (iv-b) discharge TOGETHER
//! (BG-FID-005-SRF). The surface discharge is per-cell over the shared
//! parameter grid: (b) the grid-vertex projection correspondence at every
//! interior vertex (bivariate Krawczyk) and (c) non-adjacent separation over a
//! 2D BVH. The surface double-sheet negative test — two sheets inside one
//! normal tube with correct tangent planes on BOTH — lives in the test module.
//!
//! `sigma_cl` is NOT gated here: standalone rep has no arrangement context;
//! BG-FID-006's consumer adds its condition where it exists.
