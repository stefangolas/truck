//! BG-FID-008: the one-sheet condition (iv-a) for CURVE components.
//!
//! Conditions (i)-(iii) of the isotopy lemma make the normal projection
//! restricted to an approximant a proper local homeomorphism — a covering of
//! SOME constant finite degree. They do NOT force degree one, so a checker
//! implementing only (i)-(iii) passes topologically wrong output. This module
//! discharges **(iv-a)** for curves: [`fibre_degree_one`] certifies that one
//! witnessed normal disc meets the approximant exactly once, by root isolation
//! over the whole approximant parameter span (the Krawczyk operator,
//! BG-NUM-003, N=1) with certified exclusion everywhere else.
//!
//! What a positive answer establishes is degree-one ON ONE DISC. Nothing in
//! this module is an isotopy, homeomorphism or one-sheet certificate, and
//! nothing claims any bridge lemma as proved: the bridge lemmas L-TUBE /
//! L-COVERING / L-SEPARATES remain OPEN obligations that this module cites as
//! fed, never as proved.
//!
//! Deferrals (both documented, neither stubbed):
//! - the SURFACE case needs 2D root certification in the normal bundle and
//!   lands with **BG-FID-005**, where the emitter's own cell partition makes
//!   discharge (iv-b) free;
//! - discharge **(iv-b)** itself also lands with BG-FID-005 — no emitter
//!   partition exists here to feed it.
//!
//! The reduction to a single fibre is licensed ONLY by conditions (i)-(iii)
//! already holding on this component; the function takes no (i)-(iii) data and
//! its contract states that precondition verbatim.
//!
//! # Resolution limit
//!
//! The certificate is resolution-honest: distinct roots separated by less than
//! [`width_floor`] in parameter are counted once, and a root whose distance to
//! the disc boundary is below its floor-box image radius refuses as
//! [`OneSheetError::SheetCountUnresolved`] rather than guessing a side. A box
//! of ANY width whose Krawczyk call cannot certify is retried ONCE on the
//! box widened four next-float steps per endpoint (toward -inf below, toward
//! +inf above): a root that sat within 1-2 ulps of the original box edge
//! becomes strictly interior with multi-ulp margins, and a second
//! refusal is `SheetCountUnresolved` as before (at the floor) or a
//! subdivision (above it). A certificate that states its
//! own resolution is stricter than one that does not.
