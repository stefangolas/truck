//! BG-ENC-003-BSPLINE: `EnclosureCurve for BSplineCurve<Point3>`.
//!
//! The first **spline** carrier: a `BSplineCurve<Point3>` is not closed-form but
//! a basis sum, and its enclosure is *not* computed by evaluating that sum in
//! interval arithmetic. The technique is the **convex-hull property**: over a
//! knot span a B-spline lies in the convex hull of its control points, so to
//! enclose the curve over a box `tt` one extracts the sub-curve over `tt` by
//! Boehm knot insertion and bounds the sub-curve's control points. This is
//! tighter than naive interval arithmetic on the basis sum (which suffers
//! dependency loss) and cheaper (no interval basis evaluation).
//!
//! The tangent cone comes off the **hodograph**: `BSplineCurve::derivation()`
//! returns the derivative curve, whose control points are the scaled forward
//! differences. The derivative hull contains 0 exactly where the tangent
//! direction is undefined — that is the `None` case.
//!
//! Four decisions deviate from the packet (recorded in `RESULT.json`):
//!
//! - **Out-of-range `tt`.** Decision 5 unions `Box3::point(origin)` on the claim
//!   that the Cox–de Boor basis is non-negative everywhere and sums to at most 1
//!   outside the active domain. That claim is false for this crate's evaluation
//!   path: `der_n` runs the basis recursion with the parameter left outside the
//!   knot range, and the extrapolation is the boundary polynomial itself
//!   (verified: the quadratic `t²−t` witness returns `subs(−10) = (110, 0, 0)`
//!   and `subs(10) = (90, 0, 0)`), which is unbounded as `|t| → ∞`. The origin
//!   union under-estimates — a BG-ENC-001 silent wrong answer. The sound
//!   replacement is the entire line per axis.
//! - **Degenerate point boxes.** Decision 5's `lo >= hi` branch returns the
//!   empty box, but a box `[0.25, 0.25]` has image the single point
//!   `subs(0.25)`; the packet's own witness requires that point box, so `lo ==
//!   hi` is hulled as the point (decision 4's widening included).
//! - **Hull widening.** Decision 4 widens each hull endpoint a single ulp, but
//!   the f64 Boehm insertion and `cut` recompute control points with rounding
//!   that can push the source curve's evaluation several ulps outside the
//!   extracted sub-curve's control-point hull (measured up to ~10 ulps). The
//!   endpoints are therefore padded by `HULL_PAD (1 + |·|)` instead.
//! - **Degree-0 boundary values.** `subs(hi)` of the source curve uses the
//!   right-open value from the piece just past `hi`, which a degree-0
//!   (piecewise-constant) hodograph does not represent in its sub-curve; the
//!   hull therefore also includes `subs(lo)` and `subs(hi)` themselves.
