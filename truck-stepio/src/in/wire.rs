//! Wires that are known to close *topologically*.
//!
//! A face is trimmed by its boundary, and a boundary is only a boundary if it
//! closes: walking the edges in order, each one must end where the next begins,
//! and the last must end where the first began. An open chain does not separate
//! inside from outside, so trimming with one is meaningless — but it is not
//! *inert*. The tessellator joins the loose ends with whatever is nearest and
//! produces a smooth, plausible, wrong region.
//!
//! Fail-whole-bound conversion made every edge in a wire resolve or none, which
//! rules out the wire with a hole punched in the middle. It cannot rule out a
//! wire whose edges all resolved and simply do not join up, and it held only
//! because one function happened to be written correctly.
//! [`TopologicallyClosedWire`] is the type that makes it hold everywhere: the
//! only way to obtain one is [`TopologicallyClosedWire::try_new`], which walks
//! the chain.
//!
//! Closure is checked on vertex identity, not position. Two `VERTEX_POINT`
//! entities at the same coordinates are two vertices, and a wire that relies on
//! them coinciding is relying on the exporter, not on the topology.
//!
//! **The qualifier in the name is load-bearing** (`MATHEMATICAL_FOUNDATION.md`
//! §24). Three different closure propositions exist and no one of them implies
//! another: closure by vertex identity (`TOP-004`, this type), metric endpoint
//! agreement (`ARR-001`), and closure modulo the period lattice (`QUO-002`).
//! This type establishes the first only. An unqualified `ClosedWire` — which is
//! what this was called until §33a item 1 — asserts all three to every reader,
//! and inviting that inference is exactly the failure the architecture exists
//! to prevent.
