//! Typed identities and transactional arenas.
//!
//! Conversion from STEP has two kinds of number in it and they were both
//! `usize`: the entity id a file writes as `#1234`, and the position a
//! converted value ends up at in a vector. Nothing in the type system kept them
//! apart, and nothing tied a position to the value that was actually stored
//! there.
//!
//! That gap is where the worst defect of this codebase lived. An index was
//! claimed from a map's length *before* the conversion that decides whether the
//! value exists; when the conversion failed the value was never pushed but the
//! map kept its entry, so map and vector desynchronised and every later lookup
//! addressed its neighbour. Faces then received a curve belonging to a
//! different surface — valid geometry in the wrong place, which meshes into a
//! large smooth wrong region rather than failing.
//!
//! The fix is not to be careful. It is to make the careless version
//! inexpressible:
//!
//! - [`SourceId`] and [`Index`] are distinct types, and each is tagged with the
//!   kind of thing it refers to, so an edge position cannot be passed where a
//!   vertex position belongs and neither can be confused with an entity id.
//! - An [`Index`] is obtainable only from [`Arena::get_or_try_insert`] or a
//!   lookup that found one, and `get_or_try_insert` runs the conversion
//!   *first*, so a position exists only once the value occupying it does.
//!
//! The invariant `items.len() == positions.len()`, with every position
//! addressing the value converted from the id that maps to it, is therefore
//! maintained by construction rather than asserted after the fact.
//!
//! Contracts: `TOP-001` (source reference integrity), `TOP-002` (transactional
//! conversion insertion), `TOP-007` (canonical entity identity). See
//! `MATHEMATICAL_FOUNDATION.md` §22.
//!
//! Structural correctness and retained evidence are separate requirements, and
//! only the first is free. Storing the identity is not needed to *maintain*
//! TOP-001 in a correct arena; it is needed to check it rather than trust it
//! ([`Arena::get_checked`]), to name the entity in a failure report, and to keep
//! provenance once the source table is out of scope. So every item carries its
//! own [`SourceId`] — one `u64` per entity, one integer compare per checked
//! lookup.
