//! BG-SOL-RW2-SPLIT — the fragment splitter (the Boundary Rewrite's first
//! topology packet).
//!
//! Every face a [`ContactEvent`] touches is split along the certified contact
//! loci, reusing the old transversal wire-mutation pattern (`add_edge` /
//! `add_independent_loop` / `cut_with_parameter` / `swap_edge_into_wire`, all
//! rebuilt here against the certified records — transversal is rewritten, not
//! extended). The split edges are SHARED INSTANCES between the two solids'
//! fragment wires: edge identity (the shared `Arc` curve) is what lets the
//! assembled shell close in RW4.
//!
//! The per-arm semantics (plan §4 Phase 4, session 36):
//!
//! - FF Transverse `Analytic(Curve | TwoCurves)` — the exact curve is inserted
//!   into BOTH named faces as shared edge instances. `Line` is open, a full
//!   period `Circle`/`Ellipse` is closed. A closed curve strictly inside a
//!   face's region enters as the doubled independent loop; a curve crossing
//!   the face's boundary is clipped at the two extreme crossings certified by
//!   `Point` events; `Parabola`/`Hyperbola` refuse.
//! - `Point` loci (Transverse) — cut the named edges at the parameter
//!   projection of the certified point.
//! - FE `BoundedCurve` (CoincidentInterval) — the sewing oracle: an edge of
//!   one solid lying on a face of the other is REUSED (cut to the arc's
//!   extent) when the face's split produces a boundary along its carrier.
//! - Region2 `Coincident` — the containment screen between the two faces; a
//!   containing face is split along the contained face's boundary wires and a
//!   `CoincidentPair` is emitted.
//! - `ValidatedBranchCover` loci and `Tangency`-kind records refuse
//!   (`ContactReductionDeferred`, the RW-ARC-CONT / RW-TANGENT follow-ups).
//!
//! House rules H-1..H-8 apply.
