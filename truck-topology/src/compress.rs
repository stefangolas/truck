//! Topological data structures in truck is subject to editing and has complex reference relationships.
//! They are not suitable for direct serialization and must be converted to lighter and simpler data structures.
//! These structures, prefixed with `Compressed`, are a group of structures that are easy to serialize,
//! but not suitable for real-time shape editing.
//!
//! They directly reflect the results of parsing data from json or STEP, and all member variables are public.
//! Boundary connectivity and closure are checked when converting to proprietary data structures, `Vertex`, `Edge`, and so on.
